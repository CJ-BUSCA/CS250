    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are actually described by a user story that outlines a particular task that a developer must perform in order to properly define and implement a function using code.

    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The software development approach should be a continuous and incremental improvement. This is the basic principle of Agile development which approaches should include something that defines history. Practicing story pointing, user story generation, identify sprint lengths, and SCRUM fundamentals.

    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
This means that we are passionate about every step in the program development process. Your role in the software development process also extends to other areas. Contribute to the team and it's not just the role you choose, but the ways you contribute externally and internally within the software.
